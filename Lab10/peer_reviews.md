# Review 1

Hello Nicol√≤,

I've conducted a review of your code and wanted to share my observations.

## My 2 cents:

Your code is well-structured and organized. I particularly appreciate the clear division into classes, managing both the game logic and player behaviors. This choice significantly enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.

The option to test the trained player in a match against a human player is very interesting. This feature makes your code interactive, providing an immediate test of the achieved results during training.

The integration of graphs at the end of the lab provides a comprehensive view of the learning process. This is a positive touch that offers a visual overview of the agent's performance throughout the training matches.

## Recommended Adjustments:

- The _start_game()_ function might be considered redundant as it merely prints a static string. You may want to evaluate whether it's essential to keep this function.
- The print statements during training could be shortened to enhance file readability. Consider reducing the length of the prints while retaining essential information.

## Future Developments:

- It could be interesting to explore varying the epsilon variable as the algorithm learns to play. This might help reduce randomness in the agent's moves and reduce exploration during the learning process.
- Additionally, it would be compelling to train the agent against players using different strategies. This could provide insights into how well the agent adapts to diverse playing styles.

_Overall, you've done an excellent job. Keep it up and consider the suggestions to further enhance your code_ :)

# Review 2

Hello Miki,

I've chosen your code for the peer review.

## My 2 cents:

I find your algorithm well-crafted and clear. The logic is easy to follow, contributing to the overall clarity of the code.

I appreciated the fact that, in the final part of the code, you showcase the results obtained by pitting your model against various opponents using different techniques. This provides valuable insights into how well your model performs against diverse strategies.

The visual representation of results in the form of a data table is highly useful. It allows for a clear understanding of the achieved outcomes.

The readme file in the folder is helpful and provides a good introduction for those who wish to study the code you've written.

## Recommended Adjustments:

- Adding comments within the code would enhance its comprehensibility. Consider including comments to explain specific sections or functions.
- Improving code readability by inserting spaces between different logical blocks within the same function would be beneficial.

## Future Developments:

It could be interesting to train the model against specific strategies or combinations of strategies, rather than solely random players. For instance, training it against known strategies while leaving some opponents with "unknown" strategies could provide a more accurate final assessment, as it would face adversaries it has never encountered.

_Overall, you've done a great job. Keep it up and consider the suggestions to further enhance your code_ :)
